# Hello World

This is my first post on my new blog. It's incredibly lightweight — just a single HTML file, a JSON manifest, and markdown files in a folder.

## Why This Setup?

I wanted something:

- **Zero dependencies** — no npm, no build step, no framework
- **Full control** — I can edit every line of CSS
- **Simple workflow** — write markdown, push, done

## What I Can Write

The markdown parser handles all the basics:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links to things](https://example.com)
- Lists (like this one)
- Code blocks
- Blockquotes
- Images

Here's some code:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

And a blockquote:

> The best blog is the one you actually write in.

That's it. Simple, fast, mine.
